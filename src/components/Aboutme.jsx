                  Hello! I’m a passionate web developer and a current B.Tech
                  student in Computer Science and Engineering, blending
                  creativity with technical expertise to build modern,
                  responsive web applications. My journey in tech is fueled by a
                  deep enthusiasm for learning and exploring new tools and
                  technologies.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  With a strong foundation in JavaScript and Node.js, I’m adept
                  at both front-end and back-end development, creating seamless,
                  interactive user experiences and robust backend services. On
                  the front end, I excel in designing responsive, visually
                  appealing interfaces using React, Tailwind CSS, and Bootstrap.
                  For the back end, I leverage tools like Node.js, Express.js,
                  MongoDB, and MySQL to build scalable and efficient APIs and
                  databases.
                </p>
                <br />

                <p>
                  I’m also skilled with essential development tools such as Git,
                  GitHub, Postman, Figma, and Photoshop, ensuring streamlined
                  workflows and visually compelling designs. Whether it’s a
                  single-page application or a full-scale web platform, I’m
                  excited to turn ideas into reality with code. Driven by a
                  constant curiosity, I enjoy diving into new technologies,
                  enhancing my skills, and crafting projects that solve
                  real-world problems. Let’s build something great together!
